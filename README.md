### github (notes from [hello-world_guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/))
* a website for version control, and collaboration
* the main characteristics include "repositories", "branches", "commits", and "pull requests"

1. Repositories
   * used to organize a single project
   * contains anything the project need, and a ``README.md``
2. Branches
   * used to work on different versions of a repository at one time
   * one branch named ``master`` is considered to be the definitive branch
   * other branches are used to experiment and make edits before committing them to ``master``
   * when you create a branch off the ``master`` branch, you are making a copy, or a snapshot, of the ``master`` as it was at that point in time, and you can pull in others' updates on ``master`` afterwards.
   * when the change is ready, you can merge your branches into ``master``
3. Make and Commit changes
   * *commits* are saved changes
   * each commit has an associated *commit message*, which explains why a particular change was made
